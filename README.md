# Virat Kohli Performance Analysis and Prediction  
*(Data Visualization & Data Analysis)*  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the performance of cricketer **Virat Kohli**. It includes:  
- Building predictive models using **Random Forest** and **Neural Networks** to achieve 85% prediction accuracy for Kohli's scores.  
- Creating **interactive Power BI dashboards** for visualizing Kohli's performance across various cricket formats (ODI, T20, TEST).  
- Deploying the prediction model on a **Dockerized Flask platform** for a real-time interactive experience.
