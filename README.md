Have extracted the statistics of Virat Kohli from web via webscraping,
Used the dataset to visualize his performances in various formats - ODI,T20,TEST.

Worked with powerBI as my data visualization tool. The png's i have uploaded shows the lookup of my 3 visualisations created.

Also have created a prediction model of virat to predict his score on a match on avg. based on the opponents,venue,format,etc..
