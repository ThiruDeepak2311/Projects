# Virat Kohli Performance Analysis and Prediction   

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the performance of cricketer **Virat Kohli**. It includes:  
- Building predictive models using **Random Forest** and **Neural Networks** to achieve 85% prediction accuracy for Kohli's scores.  
- Creating **interactive Power BI dashboards** for visualizing Kohli's performance across various cricket formats (ODI, T20, TEST).  
- Deploying the prediction model on a **Dockerized Flask platform** for a real-time interactive experience.

2. **Predictive Modeling**:  
   - Built a machine learning model to predict Kohli's score based on:  
     - **Opponent**  
     - **Venue**  
     - **Match Format (ODI, T20, TEST)**  
   - Achieved an **85% prediction accuracy** using **Random Forest** and **Neural Network models**.  

3. **Deployment**:  
   - The prediction model is deployed on a **Dockerized Flask platform** for real-time interaction.
